**Data and analysis for 'Offspring size resolves a latitudinal population growth rate paradox in rays and skates.'**

------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the data (single phylogenetic tree from Stein et al., 2018 and batoid model data frame) and analysis for model fitting for the paper 'Offspring size resolves a latitudinal population growth rate paradox in rays and skates', published in [insert publication info]. The repository contains a single script ```batoid-rmax-offspring-scaling.R``` required to fit phylogenetic generalised linear models with data available in the `/data` directory.

R script edited from https://github.com/EBarrowclift/batoid-rmax-scaling created for the paper Barrowclift et al.,, 2023. 'Tropical rays are intrinsically more sensitive to overfishing than the temperate skates'. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110003.
